# Phase locking and correlations in globus pallidus: data and code repository


### Data and code used for analysis, simulations and plots in the article:

* "Phase delays between mouse globus pallidus neurons entrained by common oscillatory drive arise from their intrinsic properties, not their coupling" *

This repository contains all raw and aggregated data necessary to reproduce the figures in the article.
Additional data, including experimental raw data and neural network simulation outputs, are available upon request.


## List of figures:

### Figure 1: 
GPe neurons driven periodically exhibit phase locking.

### Figure 2:
Intrinsic neuronal properties (iPRC Fourier modes) determine the phase of neural firing in response to periodic input.

### Figure 3: 
Return maps determine the shape of the spike phase distributions across frequencies.

### Figure 4: 
Pairwise CIFs during sinusoidal driving are predicted from the phase distributions across all frequencies.

### Figure 5: 
Experimental CIFs show frequency-dependent amplitude and broad distributions of phase delays.

### Figure 6: 
Unconnected in silico phase model neurons produce CIF amplitude and phase delay distributions that closely resemble the experimental data.

### Figure 7: 
Impact of local neuronal connectivity on CIFs in GPe neurons.
